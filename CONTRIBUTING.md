# Want to conribute to the project?

We allow anyone to work on the project so long as they apply for a special contributors license from us, any code they submit back to us will be under our contributors license and 
not under the GPLv2 license.

Essentially contributors of this project will grant a license to all contributors of this project to allow us to make money from any sales of our special license which you can read
about in the README.md file. When ever someone purchases a special license for Dragon Compiler this money is split between all contributors of this software. They receive
the percentage of their contribution in cash. For example if we sold a license to Dragon Compiler for 100 dollars and Dan has made 90% of the contributions of this project.
Dan will receive 90 dollars. The remaining 10 percent will go to Mary who contributed 10%.

This type of system will allow Dragon Compiler to grow and for everyone involved to make real money if someone decides to buy a special license from us. We will
only accept contributons from people who agree to license their intellectual property back to us under the contributors license we will give you. We cannot
accept work for those who choose to remain with the GPL license as then we cannot legally distribute your changes. With a contributors license granting us
the right to redistribute your code to others and allowing your code to also be used under the contributors license, we can ensure a fair legal playing ground,
where visitors of this repository can choose to be under the GPLv2 license or pay for our special license where all contributors then make money fairly.
